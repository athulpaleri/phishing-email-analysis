# Phishing Email Analysis – Task 

## Email Details:
- **From:** support@amazn-login.com  
- **Subject:** Urgent! Account Locked Due to Suspicious Activity


## Observations and Indicators of Phishing:

1. Sender Email Looks Suspicious 
   The domain used is `amazn-login.com` which closely mimics the real Amazon domain (`amazon.com`). This is a classic example of email spoofing where attackers slightly alter the name to trick the recipient.

2. Link Redirects to Fake Site
   When hovering over the link provided in the email, it points to `http://amazn-security-check.com/login`. This isn’t a legitimate Amazon URL, and clicking it could lead to a phishing site that steals login credentials.

3. Urgent and Fear-Inducing Language  
   The message says the account will be “permanently locked in 24 hours,” which creates pressure to act quickly. This is a common psychological trick used in phishing to make victims panic.

4. Generic Greeting 
   The email begins with “Dear User” instead of addressing the recipient by name. Professional services like Amazon usually include the user’s name for personalization.

5. Tone and Grammar Issues  
   Some sentences sound unnatural or too robotic. While not extreme, the writing lacks the polish typically found in official communication from big companies.



## Final Conclusion:

This email has several signs of being a phishing attempt: a misleading sender address, fake link, urgency in tone, and poor personalization. It’s clearly trying to trick users into clicking the link and entering their login details.  

To stay safe, always double-check the sender’s domain, never click links in suspicious emails, and report such messages to the appropriate security team or platform.
